### A simple time of day class written in typescript

It includes methods for converting to:
 - js builtin `Date` class
 - string
 - and a format to use when comparing two `Time`s (ex. 10:20 ==> 1020)

It also has static methods to convert to a `Time` object:
 - from `Date`
 - from timespan (ex. 10:20 ==> {hour: 10, minute: 20})
